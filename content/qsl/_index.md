## About QSL Cards

QSL cards are postcard-sized acknowledgments that radio operators exchange to verify two-way radio communication. They serve as confirmation that a contact was made, and include details such as the date, time, frequency, and signal report from the exchange. Collecting QSL cards is a cherished tradition in the amateur radio community and helps operators remember meaningful contacts with other hams across the globe.
