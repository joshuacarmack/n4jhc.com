Hi, I’m Joshua Carmack. I live in Kingsport, TN with my wife, Meg, and our cat, Romeo. By profession, I work in the field of Information Technology and hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from East Tennessee State University.

Technology has been a passion of mine since elementary school, when I first discovered my love for computers. That interest led me to volunteer for my church’s technical team at a young age—a role that shaped much of my journey. Today, I’m grateful to serve as the Technical Director for my church, helping bring excellence to live production and creative media.

This website is a space where I share my hobbies, projects, and explorations in areas such as:

- Ham radio

- Photography

- Audio & videography

- Livestream set-ups

- Drone flying

- 3D printing

- Programming

- Web development

Whether I’m tinkering with new tech, experimenting with creative production, or exploring the world through a lens or radio waves, I enjoy learning and sharing what I discover along the way.

Thanks for stopping by—I hope you find inspiration, helpful insights, or just an appreciation for the same things that excite me.
